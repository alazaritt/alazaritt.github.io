The board includes a microphone for detecting sound, with an op-amp used to tune the analog signal before it is read by the onboard ADC of the PIC18F57Q43 microcontroller. A digital output signal is then sent to a teammate's board to trigger a response.</p> <p>The subsystem operates at 5V of power via a voltage regulator. A single reset button is included as a digital input. Communication with the main control board is handled through an 8-pin ribbon cable, using one digital signal line and ground. The block diagram documents all major connections, power domains, signal directions, microcontroller use, and team interconnections.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#diagram-link","title":"Diagram Link","text":"<p>A direct link to the source file of the following block diagram can be found here.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#sound-board-block-diagram","title":"Sound Board Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":"<p>Table 1: Component selection (op-amp)</p> <p>Op-amp</p> Solution Pros Cons Option 1.
